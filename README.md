#Cyclone Java

Engine classes based on the book [Game Physics: Engine Development](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-Commercial-Grade/dp/0123819768) by Ian Millington

## Goal

Simple resource to help with studying with the engine classes developed alongside the text in Java rather than C++. Obviously, some liberties were taken in the conversion.
